# Now
Spawner framework 
Upgrade framework
player death + health bar (beginning of an UI ?)
XP and level up ?

# Later
+ Gameplay, for real ?
+ Make enemy shooting less ryhtmic
+ Melee as hitscan rather than projectile reskin ?
+ Changing projectile to move_and_collide ?

# Idea

# DONE (in reverse)
Animation manager rework to support fully scene and animated sprite + breathing complete rework
Add item to actor stat and display of scene instead of spriteframe
Decouple cooldown and target seek
Enemy melee attack & melee attack logic -> Need team logic
Melee attack logic (simple reskinning of fire projectile)
Hit Spark
Hit point current -> now set at actor node ready
Optimisation - no nav on enemy and area to find player is not monitorable
Item motion enum

# COPY/PASTA
get_last_slide_collision() -> KinematicCollision2D
