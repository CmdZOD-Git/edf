# Now
Spawner framework 
Upgrade framework
player death + health bar (beginning of an UI ?)
XP and level up ?

# Later
+ Gameplay, for real ?
+ Melee as hitscan rather than projectile reskin ?
+ Changing projectile to move_and_collide ?

# Idea

# DONE
Item motion enum
Optimisation - no nav on enemy and area to find player is not monitorable
Hit point current -> now set at actor node ready
Hit Spark
Melee attack logic (simple reskinning of fire projectile)
Enemy melee attack & melee attack logic -> Need team logic

# COPY/PASTA
get_last_slide_collision() -> KinematicCollision2D
